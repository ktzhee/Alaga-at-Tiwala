                <p id="desctext">Alaga at Tiwala is an organization that aims to increase awareness and stress the value of appropriate family planning. We believe that denying a person access to proper family planning will only lead to complications in family stability and well-being. Such complications include poor financial stability, mental health problems, and death or disability related to complications in childbirth and pregnancy. The page aims to educate visitors on family planning options, child rights, and legal support available in the Philippines. Its goal is to provide support for victims and to promote healthier families and well-being in the community.</p>

            <p id="origin-text">Alaga at Tiwala began as a small initiative focused on educating families about the importance of proper family planning, child welfare, and support. We were a firsthand witness to the lack of access to reproductive health information in Philippine families and communities. This lack of awareness impacted families' stability and child well-being. After seeing this, our founder was inspired to create a platform that aimed to empower individuals with knowledge and support. Over time, we expanded our reach, and now our organization is UNESCO-accredited, equipped with a passionate team dedicated to fostering healthier families and safer communities across the Philippines.</p>

                    <p id="founder-desc">
                        I am Christine Mecha M. Polestico, the founder and lead advocate of Alaga at Tiwala. I was born into an unstable and separated family. I have personally experienced the challenges and vulnerabilities that unstable families can cause for a child's development and wellness. My personal experiences inspired me to create Alaga at Tiwala. I want to ensure that every family has the resources to build strong and supportive environments.
                        <br> <br>After graduating from Philippine Science High School Southern Mindanao Campus (PSHS SMC), I went on to earn a Bachelor of Science in Environmental Science from the University of California, Berkeley. I have been honored to speak at prominent forums such as the Philippine Youth Health Advocacy Summit and the Asia-Pacific Family Planning Convention, sharing our mission to empower families and protect children. My education and experiences support my dedication to our cause. They reinforce my commitment to fostering awareness and collaboration across communities and institutions. As of now, our cause has only been able to impact the Philippines, but I will make sure that we can expand abroad. This is to ensure that everyone has access to proper family planning.
